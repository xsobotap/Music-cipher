Powerfull tool for hiding information into music composition

We designed system for hiding the information into music. Not like modern steganography, that hides information in the sound, but more like the work of classical composers mentioned above. Our system takes the information and transform it into musical structure of the song. With use of harmony, rhythm and melody, that the listener is not aware that the song was composed automatically, and on top of that that the song, has hidden meaning.
